1. For this project I was able to complete up until the multiplication by zero function. 
I was also able to finish implement testing for each of the functions

2. I'm still not completely familiar with python so this project help me understand how to use
self in python classes.

3. I think the part I struggled with the most was figuring out how to implement testing for each of the functions.
I would have appreciated having more practice with opening files on python. 

;;> Tests are a bit sparse, but the implementation is very well done here!
